I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Sciences, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) from Fall 2018. I am currently advised by [Prof. Cheng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Fdv_mIAAAAJ). I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Sciences from [Sichuan University](https://scu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests focus on Distributed DNN systems, LLM systems.

**Expected to graduate in November 2025, I am actively seeking AI Infrastructure-related positions in the industry, preferably in Shanghai.**
