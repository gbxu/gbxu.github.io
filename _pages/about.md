I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Sciences, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) from Fall 2018. I am currently advised by [Prof. Cheng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Fdv_mIAAAAJ). I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Sciences (with [honors](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E5%AD%A6%E7%A7%91%E6%8B%94%E5%B0%96%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%9F%B9%E5%85%BB%E8%AF%95%E9%AA%8C%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92/3486963)) from [Sichuan University](https://scu.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests focus on Distributed DNN systems, LLM systems.

**Expected to graduate in November 2025, I am actively seeking AI Infrastructure-related positions in the industry, preferably in Shanghai.**
